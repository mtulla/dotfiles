Run the dotfiles setup test in Docker and analyze the results.

1. Run `./test-setup.sh` and capture the full output.
2. Analyze the output for any failures — look for `[ERR]`, `FAILED`, non-zero exit codes, or missing tools.
3. Summarize what succeeded and what failed.
4. If there are failures, identify the root cause and suggest fixes.
